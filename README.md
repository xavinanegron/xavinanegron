  ## 🦋 A Bit About Myself

👋🏻 Greetings! I'm Xavina. 

-As a **computer science undergrad**, I have a passion for acquiring knowledge beyond the classroom. My goal is to apply theoretical concepts to real-world coding challenges. 🌎👩🏼‍💻

-I'm currently enrolled in Nucamp's Full Stack Web and Mobile App Development bootcamp, where I'm delving into front-end technologies like **JavaScript**, **React** and **React Native**, as well as back-end with **Node.js**, and database management with **MongoDB**. 📚

-My passion lies in combining solid computer science fundamentals with the artistry of web development. 

-Join me on my coding journey, where algorithms meet elegant UIs. ✨
