  ## A Bit About Myself 🌙🦋

### 👋🏻 Greetings! I'm Xavina. 

-As a **computer science undergraduate**, my dedication for learning extends beyond the classroom. In addition to my coursework, I actively practice coding challenges and work on projects outside of class, striving to apply theoretical concepts to real-world scenarios. 🌎👩🏼‍💻

-Currently, I'm enhancing my skills through **Nucamp's Full Stack Web and Mobile App Development bootcamp**. Here, I'm immersing myself in front-end technologies such as **JavaScript**, **React**, and **React Native**, alongside back-end development with **Node.js**, and database management with **MongoDB**. 📚🎓

-Come along as I blend computer science fundamentals with **creative web design**, shaping elegant UIs where **logic** and **simplicity** combine. 💡✨💻
