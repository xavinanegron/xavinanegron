  ## 🦋 A Little About Me

👋🏻 Greetings! I'm Xavina. 

-As a computer science undergrad, I extend my pursuit of knowledge beyond the classroom. This propels me to apply theoretical concepts to practical coding challenges in the real world.

-Currently, I'm a student of Nucamp's Full Stack Web and Mobile App Development bootcamp.

-My passion lies in combining solid computer science fundamentals with the artistry of full-stack web development.

-Join me on my coding journey, where algorithms meet elegant UIs. ✨
