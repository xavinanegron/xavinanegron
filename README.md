  ## 🦋 A Bit About Myself

👋🏻 Greetings! I'm Xavina. 

-As a **computer science undergraduate**, my enthusiasm for learning extends beyond the classroom. My goal is to apply theoretical concepts to real-world coding challenges. 🌎👩🏼‍💻

-Currently, I'm enhancing my skills through Nucamp's Full Stack Web and Mobile App Development bootcamp. Here, I'm immersing myself in front-end technologies such as **JavaScript**, **React**, and **React Native**, alongside back-end development with **Node.js**, and mastering database management with **MongoDB**. 📚

-Come along as I blend computer science fundamentals with creative web design, shaping elegant UIs where logic and simplicity sync. 🛠️📝
