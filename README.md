  ## 🦋 A Little About Me

👋🏻 Greetings! I'm Xavina. 

-As a **computer science undergrad**, I have a passion for acquiring knowledge that extends beyond the classroom. My goal is to apply theoretical concepts to real-world coding challenges!

-I'm currently enrolled in Nucamp's Full Stack Web and Mobile App Development bootcamp, where I'm delving into technologies like **JavaScript**, web and mobile development with **React** and **React Native**, backend development with **Node.js**, and database management with **MongoDB**.

-My passion lies in combining solid computer science fundamentals with the artistry of web development.

-Join me on my coding journey, where algorithms meet elegant UIs. ✨
